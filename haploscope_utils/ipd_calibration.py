    """Run the full IPD calibration task

    On a haploscope, two images are presented, one to each eye. The
    construction of the haploscope is done with the mirrors in a
    position such that the images in each eye would be perfectly
    centered at optical infinity, i.e., if the user's eyes were staring
    straight ahead. This is not what actually happens; people's eyes
    will fixate on some point, and so have some convergence angle
    (optical infinity is equivalent to having a convergence angle of 0
    degrees). We will need to shift the image forward by this amount.

    However, that's only a first-pass approximation, as successful
    fusion of stereo-presented images depends on more than just the a
    person's IPD. Therefore, we also provide a task to allow the user to
    make small adjustments to the location of two objects in order to
    find the appropriate offset for successful fusion. The subject will
    adjust the location of two objects (a circle and a line), presented
    in separate eyes, until the line goes through the center of the
    circle. This is done ``num_runs`` times (each run starts with a bit
    of noise, an integer drawn from a uniform distribution from -5 to 5,
    in both directions), and then we append these results to an
    ipd_correction.csv file in the ``output_dir``, where we're keeping
    track of this information.

    If you want to use the information stored in this csv, the
    ``csv_to_binocular_offset.py`` script will help you with that

        The subject's inter-pupillary distance (IPD), that is, the

    output_dir : str
        Path to the directory where we'll output the results, in
        ipd_correction.csv
    screen : list
        List of ints giving the identifiers for the screens to run the
        task on. Can contain one or two values.
    size : list
        List of 2 ints, containing (width, height) of the screen(s) in
        pixels. Used for converting between pixels and
        degrees. Currently, all screens must have same size. Default
        value is for the FancyPants v1 haploscope
    fixation_distance : float
        The fixation distance of the monitor, in cm. Default value is
        for the FancyPants v1 haploscope
    monitor_cm_width : float
        Width of the monitor, in cm. Default value is for the FancyPants
        v1 haploscope
    num_runs : int
        Number of times to run this the calibration task. We'll store

        results for a given subject.
    flip_text : bool, optional
        Boolean, whether to left-right reverse everything. If True,
        everything will be flipped, as you need on the haploscope. If
        False, everything will be the right way round. This flips the
        text but also reverses the direction the left/right arrow keys
        move the stimuli
    allow_large_ipd : bool
        It's easy to mess up and give an IPD in mm instead of cm, but we
        require cm. In order to help check that, by default, we'll raise
        an Exception if binocular_ipd is larger than 10, because that
        would be very large. If you really do have IPDs larger than 10
        cm for either of those values, you can set this flag to True and
        we won't raise the Exception (but we'll still raise a warning).

        Other keyword=value pairs will be passed directly to the
        creation of the Psychopy.visual.Window objects
    line_length : int

    line_width : int
        Width of the line stimulus, in pixels
    circle_radius : int
        Radius of the circle stimulus, in pixels
    line_on_duration : float, optional
